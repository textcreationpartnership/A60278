         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I Have touched in the former paſſages how Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be placed in the exerciſes, and practick part thereof, as the ſubduing of the body with auſterity of food, and rayment; by which external means <hi>Man</hi> rather came to the notice of our ſorrow, than <hi>God;</hi> for the Almighty as he is the ſearcher of the reins, and heart, hath an eye principally upon thoſe inward parts to ſee how they ſtand affected: I ſay,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37267:17"/>becauſe God can make a ſcrutiny into the ſpirit of man onely, it was thought fit by the <hi>Church,</hi> (which is a ſelect compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men, and underſtand as man) to preſcribe unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſuch rules to be obſerved in Repentance, whereby the ſame might appear to be real and ſincere unto them alſo: for if the <hi>Church</hi> have any power (as ſure ſhe hath) in the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement of Penitents, there muſt needs be ſome ſuch means ſuppoſed as are proportionable to the Churches apprehenſion, whereby inward contrition for ſin may be unto them demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and forthwith the party to be reconciled.

               <p>I Have formerly treated of <hi>Exhomologeſis</hi> as a wholeſome diſcipline impoſed for notorious ſins, by which the <hi>Penitent</hi> did not ſo much make known his offences, (for they were too apparent and ſcandalous) as acknowledge the injury and wrong he had done to God, and his people, and there by the judgment, and puniſhment belonging in juſtice unto ſin; and by ſuch doleful poſtures to pacifie God, and ſatisfie the Church ſcandalized by his fall. We are now to treat of ſuch a Confeſſion, which bringeth to light the works of darkneſs, whereby a ſinner becomes his own accuſer, having no other witneſſes then God, and his own Conſcience of his folly; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame not onely unto God but to Man alſo: Our firſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37267:42"/>diſquiſition muſt be to inquire whether ſins were and may be confeſſed unto a <hi>Man,</hi> without entring into the <hi>manner</hi> of the Confeſſion; whether it ought to be of all particular ſins, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the circumſtances changing, or aggravating the property of each ſeveral offence, or without conſidering ſo much the nature of the man, his profeſſion, calling, or ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (for theſe reſpects will follow in their order.) But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſinner may confeſs his ſins in general or ſpecified unto any man without reſpect of perſons; provided onely that he be within the pale of the Church, and obſerve in his carriage the common rules of civility, and we ſhall find the practice hath been, (and that practice never controlled) in all times for man to have recourſe to man alſo in confeſſion.</p>

                  </list> And here my labour might have ceaſed, there being enough in theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions for a Chriſtians practice, and a Penitents relief.

But now if that ruſt may be filed off, and if the pure juyce of the grape may be defecated from the dregs of corruption, there can be no reaſon given why the duty ſhould not again take place, and be reſtored to its wonted practice.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37267:73"/>it to the liberty of each mans Conſcience in ſubmitting himſelf to the juriſdiction thereof. If (I ſay) theſe, or any of theſe be juſt exceptions, the nerves of this argument will be ſoon abated.</p>

Let us now gather up the broken pieces of this Argument.
<list>
                        <item>1. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> is to have notice of the ſins of the <hi>Penitent</hi> before he can proceed to cenſure; that's true, but a general knowledge may ſometimes ſuffice, without exaction at all times of particular <hi>Items.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The Prieſt is conſtituted a Judge in ſuch caſes; that peradventure is true, but then he is fallible, and often erring in judgment.</item>
                        <item>3. The Prieſt remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſins; that's true in a good ſenſe; but God remitteth more properly and more then he, and many more without him.</item>
                        <item>4. The Court of Conſcience is up, the Judge enabled with authority, and is preſent at the Bench to hear; true, but liberty is left to Chriſtians to reſort, or not, to ſubmit, or not, to that juriſdiction.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus this Maſter-proof hangs together like a rope of ſand; for the matter it ſelf, I ſuppoſe, great is the authority which Chriſt in this place hath put his Prieſts in, and to great purpoſe queſtionleſs, as in due time may appear; and great care is to be taken by ſuch that depend upon them, how they fruſtrate
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37267:77"/>not the power of God, or rather their own ſouls of ſalvation; for the Prieſts bear not this power in vaine.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>and commanded his Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to heal; and hath not ſaid unto the ſick, Go ye to thoſe Phyſicians and be healed; for this he would have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for a certain and indubitate truth, that ſick men will gladly offer themſelves to Phyſicians to be cured.</hi> Let an <hi>Hospital</hi> be once erected, and endowed with maintenance for poor impotent people, and you need not command, or compel them to come in; great ſuit ſhall be made to the Founder and Overſeers for admittance. The Prieſt ſits, the Courts are open, the Medicines are prepared, the reconciling keys are in his hands, yet little or no attendance upon this Judg, no repair to this Phyſician, no ſubmiſsion to this Reconciler. To one that demanded why <hi>Philoſophers</hi> repaired to <hi>Rich mens</hi> houſes, and Rich men never to their Cells; it was anſwered,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37267:77"/>That <hi>Philoſophers</hi> knew they had need of ſuch men, but <hi>Rich men</hi> were ignorant what uſe might be made of <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> for concerning ſpiritual diſeaſes we eſteem our ſelves ſo ſound, or if we are diſeaſed, our ſelves ſo skilful, as to need none of the Lords Phyſicians. I ſay no more, but that it were better we did not ſee ſo much, or ſaw better then we do. And thus much to this argument.</p>
                  <p>Another Reaſon is yet behind, to prove confeſſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, becauſe it belongs unto the <hi>Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi> By which Sacrament the Popiſh writers underſtand not the <hi>inward Contrition</hi> of the heart, but an external ſign, and expreſſion thereof, and not every contrition ſo expreſſed; for <hi>Niniveh</hi> publiſhed her ſorrow in ſack-cloth, and in aſhes; but this Sacrament was not under the Law, but under the Goſpel; nor every external expreſſion under the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Poenitentia ſignis externis declarata, cum verbo abſolutionis eſt Sacrame itum. <hi>Bellar. l. 1. de poen. c. 8.</hi>

                     </list> Thus the Maſter; and we cannot expect better from the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for uſually they are more forward, and ſay more than thoſe that taught them: and eſpecially ſeeing the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath had ſo little compaſsion in this caſe; we are out of hope that any Divines of that ſide ſhould abate any thing of this decreed rigour.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth that we examine the grounds why this extreme neceſsity is impoſed; for Laws and ordinances are not uſually
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37267:83"/>enacted, nor neceſſarily exacted, except upon ſound purpoſes and ends. And if thoſe ends may be obtained without them, or come by upon better termes, or if the goodneſs thereof be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; the Laws are repealed, the ordinances taken away, and the neceſsity ceaſeth; this being a received <hi>Maxim,</hi> that the neceſsity of the <hi>means</hi> muſt not exceed, nor be above the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of the <hi>end;</hi> and if the <hi>end</hi> be not judged neceſſary, the like judgment muſt be had of the <hi>means.</hi> Again, ſuch <hi>means</hi> are onely deemed neceſſary, which ſerve for the attaining of the end; and ſo far forth as without them ſuch a propoſed end can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accompliſhed. For example; If eating and drinking be onely neceſſary for this life, then if I had no neceſsity to live, I might have no neceſsity to eat. Again, If I am to go a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is not neceſſary that I ſhall go afoot, becauſe I may be carried: two things then conſtitute the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>mean, aptitude,</hi> and <hi>propriety;</hi> that it be <hi>ſit,</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> fit to compaſs ſuch a deſign. Theſe notions preſuppoſed, we ſhall inquire into the foundations of this neceſsity in exacting confeſsion; and if neither the <hi>end</hi> be neceſſary to be had, nor the <hi>means</hi> ſo requiſite for the due obtaining thereof, we ſhall then caſt away this neceſsity as an exaction, it being a burden not to be endured, which is ſuſtained to no purpoſe; and a tyrannie which laies a neceſsity upon the conſcience, where Chriſtian liberty is every way as behoofeful.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ground of this impoſition is upon a ſuppoſed perill of ſalvation; for theſe men teach that as there is no reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God without remiſsion of ſin, ſo no ſin is remitted without confeſsion (or at leaſt a purpoſe thereof) unto a Prieſt; for ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

                     </note> and too urgent they cannot be, if ſo great a matter were at ſtake. But the queſtion is, whether the <hi>mean</hi> propoſed be neceſſary to this end, yea or no; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remiſsion of ſins can be obtained of God no other way? for if it may, then we muſt conclude this not to be an adequate <hi>mean</hi> conducing thereunto; for we muſt now confider of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:37267:83"/>not as an <hi>help,</hi> and a kind of mean, and in ſome ſort of ſinners onely; but whether or no it be the <hi>onely mean,</hi> for all ſinners to gain a pardon: for there can be no neceſsity for a <hi>Felon</hi> to uſe the mediation of one man onely to his Prince for pardon, except the Prince be reſolute to pardon no other way.

So then it is neceſſary to ſalvation to obey all Gods commands, or to repent for the diſobedience; although all his divine Precepts conduce not neceſſarily thereunto.<note place="margin">Joſh. 6.18.</note> At the ſacking of <hi>Jericho</hi> the ſpoils were devoted to the Lord, and the Iſraelites might reſerve nothing to themſelves; a neceſſity there lay in obeying the ſame, though the commandment it ſelf was not ſo neceſſary. In the <hi>old</hi> Law (as I ſhewed before) there was a <hi>precept</hi> for Confeſſion; and in the <hi>new,</hi> a <hi>preſident</hi> for the ſame; why ſhould it not then be thought neceſſary? But take this along with you; <hi>Poſitive Precepts</hi> contained in the <hi>Scripture</hi> are not to be extended further than the written <hi>Word,</hi> or intention of the Law-giver direct: for example, God intendeth pardon upon ſincere confeſſion of the ſin committed; which Pardon when it may be had upon confeſſion made unto <hi>God</hi> himſelf, we extend it not unto <hi>Man.</hi> So again, if it may be procured upon a general confeſſion before man, we urge not the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to be particular; but if the Conſcience cannot be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied except the pungitive ſin be diſcovered, in that caſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſpecial detection of that ſin by name. So then if the intended pardon may be compaſſed by any of theſe wayes, that way is to be reputed neceſſary for that penitent, which ſerved the turn. If by none, but by all of theſe, all of theſe then are neceſſary. Moreover, Gods word commandeth ſins to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the Prieſt in termes abſolute, without further cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; we dare not therefore extend that precept to the manner thereof; whether it ſhould be publick or private, of all ſins, or ſome, followed with remorſe of Conſcience; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the addition of aggravating circumſtances or no. I ſay we lay no neceſſity of theſe caſes upon any, becauſe we have not any expreſs word for our warrant; we counſel onely, that no man permit ſin to lie ſtill in his boſome, ſo long as he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37267:98"/>feels pain, but complain ſtill to his Phyſician, till the cure be perfect. Thus for the neceſſity of Precept.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond branch is <hi>neceſſit as medii.</hi> And we are to judge of that neceſſity by the end; for no <hi>mean</hi> can be of greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity than the <hi>end</hi> for which it ſerveth; and if the <hi>end</hi> be found neceſſary, the <hi>mean</hi> muſt be thought to be ſo, and in <hi>means</hi> we are to enquire if the propoſed <hi>end</hi> may be attained by <hi>one</hi> onely <hi>mean,</hi> or by <hi>divers;</hi> ſome means may be <hi>uſeful,</hi> but not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as a horſe for a journey, or <hi>ſimply</hi> neceſſary as wings to flie. To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, remiſsion of ſins is the end a Penitent propoſeth to himſelf, which to compaſs, we ſay that confeſsion to a Prieft is not of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſsity, as the adequate, &amp; only mean; for faith in Chriſt (who onely hath deſerved it) is alſo required; nor a neceſſary <hi>concurrent</hi> mean; for of faith I read, but never of Auricular Confeſsion; that without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God; but onely a <hi>conditional mean,</hi> and ſo the neceſsity thereof <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical,</hi> in ſome caſes of Conſcience to be inſtanced hereafter: for ſin in no caſe may be remitted without God, in many with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out man.

                  <p>In what credit ſuch Fables were, the vulgar beſt know; But in truth it was late in the world before men were called to ſo ſtrict a reckoning. In the former dayes either recourſe was made to God onely, or a general confeſſion before the Church,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:37267:109"/>or a ſpecial diſcovery of ſuch ſins which made ſuch a combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſinners breaſt, as he could not quench alone, but (the fire all about his ears) muſt call for aid of his neighbours, and amongſt them the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that are beſt able to abate thoſe flames.

I ſaid it was long before this buſie enumeration was injoyned: A general Confeſſion, or an intimation of ſome ſpeciall ſins which lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted upon the Conſcience, was chiefly required. Now if at any time ſuch ſtrictneſs were neceſſary, then at our laſt <hi>Audit,</hi> when we are <hi>in extremis,</hi> and in the ſhadow of death, and about to take our leaves of this ſinful world, and to make our peace with God whileſt the laſt grains of ſand are running in this glaſſie life. Yet as it appeareth in an ancient <hi>form</hi> of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating ſick perſons, and aſcribed to our <hi>Anſelme,</hi> the Prieſts were not then ſo particular: the form it ſelf is worthy to ſtand in this place, and is thus: <hi>The ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man languiſhing and at the point of death ought to be this interrogated,</hi>

To what end ſerved the daily prayers, the morning and evening Sacrifices under the law? To what purpoſe do we in our ſacred aſſemblies begin, and enter into our ſolemn prayers with confeſſion of our guiltineſs, but that our daily ſins might be forgiven without any further acknowledgment? Publick ſatisfactions therefore must be underſtood of ſuch ſins as are hainous, and ſcandalous to the Congregation.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Beza.</hi> The objection of <hi>Erastus</hi> was, All ſins deſerve excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore the cenſure was to be ſerved either upon all or none. <hi>Beza</hi> denies the conſequent, and ſheweth good reaſons why all ſins are not ſubject to the Cenſure; and which ſerve alſo to ſhew why all ſins are not to be ſtood upon in Confeſsion, becauſe ſins of a leſſer <hi>magnitude</hi> may be otherwiſe blotted out by private Confeſsion and tears, or by the general and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick acknowledgment of the Church; and as notorious, and ſcandalous, were onely liable to the Churches cenſure, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. So not all ſins but ſuch as afflict the conſcience, and ſuffer the ſinner to take no reſt, are neceſſary to be confeſſed. And this doctrine our Church maintaineth, and wiſheth all her children to take it to heart; carefully diſtinguiſhing the ſame from the ſo much abuſed <hi>Popiſh Auricular Confeſſion</hi> which they thruſt upon the ſouls of Chriſtians as an <hi>expiatory ſacrifice,</hi> and <hi>meritorious ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin; racking their Conſciences to confeſs when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what greater breach can there be of charity, than to rake up ſuch offences under ſilence, by the concealment whereof the King and State may be ſo highly impaired, and the juſt laws thereof not executed upon the Malefactors?

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>SO by Gods mercy, and the guidance of his good Spirit, we are now in the haven, and at the end of this Treatiſe. A journey hath been taken not long, (to ſpeak truly) nor tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but dangerous and difficult; ſpent rather in the beating of unknown paths, or renewing of ancient tracts worn out, and well-nigh deſaced with deſuetude, than in following any uſuall rode or beaten way before us; for in this voyage (we may boldly ſay) not many Travellers, eſpecially that ſet out from home with us, have kept us company. And yet the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter, as it concerns all Chriſtians, ſo I ſuppoſe, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to none of thoſe <hi>Myſteries</hi> in power and operation, that are committed to the Lords Stewards, much profiting, but much oppoſing fleſhly wiſdome; as the beſt potions are the moſt bitter, and the more repugnant to the diſeaſe, the more
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:37267:176"/>ſanative. The Spirit is contrary to the fleſh, and the work of Chriſtianity is to deny our ſelves, and to take up <hi>Chriſt's croſſe.</hi> You ſhall hardly ſee a man that will lay open his infirmities, though I read of an <hi>Apostle</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 11.30.</note> that gloried in his. Our humour is naturally Phariſaical, to make clean the outſide of the Platter, and who is he that will turn the worſt ſide outward? Very few will ſpeak evil of themſelves, and fewer that will ſuffer others to do ſo with patience. <hi>It is a fringe of pride</hi> (ſaith Gregory) <hi>in a man freely to disparage himſelf, and yet to take it ill at anothers hands that ſhall do ſo.</hi>

The Miniſters and Paſtors of <hi>Chriſts</hi> flock could wiſh no ſins for Confeſſion, no perplexity for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, no wounds, no diſeaſes in the ſoul, and that all the flock were ſo ſound and whole, that there needed no Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But they may wiſh the beſt, and fear the worſt, and find too much work for Phyſicians, if throughly imployed; too many bonds and bars for their keys, and too many infirmities for their power to work on: Confeſſion cannot be out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſo long as there are ſo ſtrong temptations to aſſault, and ſo weak a fort and poorly man'd to defend.
