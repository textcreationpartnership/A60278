         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Have formerly treated of <hi>Exhomologe≈øis</hi> as a whole≈øome di≈øcipline impo≈øed for notorious ≈øins, by which the <hi>Penitent</hi> did not ≈øo much make known his offences, (for they were too apparent and ≈øcandalous) as acknowledge the injury and wrong he had done to God, and his people, and there by the judgment, and puni≈øhment belonging in ju≈øtice unto ≈øin; and by ≈øuch doleful po≈øtures to pacifie God, and ≈øatisfie the Church ≈øcandalized by his fall. We are now to treat of ≈øuch a Confe≈ø≈øion, which bringeth to light the works of darkne≈øs, whereby a ≈øinner becomes his own accu≈øer, having no other witne≈ø≈øes then God, and his own Con≈øcience of his folly; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame not onely unto God but to Man al≈øo: Our fir≈øt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37267:42"/>di≈øqui≈øition mu≈øt be to inquire whether ≈øins were and may be confe≈ø≈øed unto a <hi>Man,</hi> without entring into the <hi>manner</hi> of the Confe≈ø≈øion; whether it ought to be of all particular ≈øins, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the circum≈øtances changing, or aggravating the property of each ≈øeveral offence, or without con≈øidering ≈øo much the nature of the man, his profe≈ø≈øion, calling, or ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (for the≈øe re≈øpects will follow in their order.) But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ≈øinner may confe≈øs his ≈øins in general or ≈øpecified unto any man without re≈øpect of per≈øons; provided onely that he be within the pale of the Church, and ob≈øerve in his carriage the common rules of civility, and we ≈øhall find the practice hath been, (and that practice never controlled) in all times for man to have recour≈øe to man al≈øo in confe≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt and mo≈øt ancient example in this kind is <hi>Lamech;</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> were called to an account, and convinced before they would come to any acknowledgment: but this man que≈øtioned by none, called upon by none, accu≈øed by none, but by the bird in his brea≈øt,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.23.</note> his <hi>Con≈øcience,</hi> cries out, <hi>Hear my voice, O ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my ≈øpeech, for I have ≈ølain a man in my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</hi> I mu≈øt confe≈øs I held not this worthy of an in≈øtance, though it be the detection of a ≈øecret ≈øin, becau≈øe it was addre≈ø≈øed unto women, unfit creatures to be acquainted with a mans Cabinet, and to look into the privy Chamber of his heart; and conceived of this pa≈ø≈øage to be as much for my purpo≈øe, as the fabulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> who the <hi>man</hi> was he ≈ølew, and the <hi>manner</hi> thereof, to the mind and meaning of <hi>Lamech;</hi> pa≈ø≈øed over it had been for me, had not <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome</hi> grounded upon the ≈øame ≈øo many, and tho≈øe notable ob≈øervations of Confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion.

<list>
                        <item>1. The <hi>Prie≈øt</hi> is to have notice of the ≈øins of the <hi>Penitent</hi> before he can proceed to cen≈øure; that's true, but a general knowledge may ≈øometimes ≈øuffice, without exaction at all times of particular <hi>Items.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The Prie≈øt is con≈øtituted a Judge in ≈øuch ca≈øes; that peradventure is true, but then he is fallible, and often erring in judgment.</item>
                        <item>3. The Prie≈øt remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ≈øins; that's true in a good ≈øen≈øe; but God remitteth more properly and more then he, and many more without him.</item>
                        <item>4. The Court of Con≈øcience is up, the Judge enabled with authority, and is pre≈øent at the Bench to hear; true, but liberty is left to Chri≈øtians to re≈øort, or not, to ≈øubmit, or not, to that juri≈ødiction.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus this Ma≈øter-proof hangs together like a rope of ≈øand; for the matter it ≈øelf, I ≈øuppo≈øe, great is the authority which Chri≈øt in this place hath put his Prie≈øts in, and to great purpo≈øe que≈øtionle≈øs, as in due time may appear; and great care is to be taken by ≈øuch that depend upon them, how they fru≈øtrate

                        <item>4. Confe≈øsion of ≈øin (if opportunity ≈øerve) is actually to be made unto God, and the Prie≈øt, upon peril of exclu≈øion from Gods kingdome.</item>
                     </list> Thus the Ma≈øter; and we cannot expect better from the di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for u≈øually they are more forward, and ≈øay more than tho≈øe that taught them: and e≈øpecially ≈øeeing the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath had ≈øo little compa≈øsion in this ca≈øe; we are out of hope that any Divines of that ≈øide ≈øhould abate any thing of this decreed rigour.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth that we examine the grounds why this extreme nece≈øsity is impo≈øed; for Laws and ordinances are not u≈øually
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37267:83"/>enacted, nor nece≈ø≈øarily exacted, except upon ≈øound purpo≈øes and ends. And if tho≈øe ends may be obtained without them, or come by upon better termes, or if the goodne≈øs thereof be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; the Laws are repealed, the ordinances taken away, and the nece≈øsity cea≈øeth; this being a received <hi>Maxim,</hi> that the nece≈øsity of the <hi>means</hi> mu≈øt not exceed, nor be above the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsity of the <hi>end;</hi> and if the <hi>end</hi> be not judged nece≈ø≈øary, the like judgment mu≈øt be had of the <hi>means.</hi> Again, ≈øuch <hi>means</hi> are onely deemed nece≈ø≈øary, which ≈øerve for the attaining of the end; and ≈øo far forth as without them ≈øuch a propo≈øed end can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accompli≈øhed. For example; If eating and drinking be onely nece≈ø≈øary for this life, then if I had no nece≈øsity to live, I might have no nece≈øsity to eat. Again, If I am to go a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is not nece≈ø≈øary that I ≈øhall go afoot, becau≈øe I may be carried: two things then con≈øtitute the <hi>nece≈ø≈øity</hi> of the <hi>mean, aptitude,</hi> and <hi>propriety;</hi> that it be <hi>≈øit,</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> fit to compa≈øs ≈øuch a de≈øign. The≈øe notions pre≈øuppo≈øed, we ≈øhall inquire into the foundations of this nece≈øsity in exacting confe≈øsion; and if neither the <hi>end</hi> be nece≈ø≈øary to be had, nor the <hi>means</hi> ≈øo requi≈øite for the due obtaining thereof, we ≈øhall then ca≈øt away this nece≈øsity as an exaction, it being a burden not to be endured, which is ≈øu≈øtained to no purpo≈øe; and a tyrannie which laies a nece≈øsity upon the con≈øcience, where Chri≈øtian liberty is every way as behoofeful.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt ground of this impo≈øition is upon a ≈øuppo≈øed perill of ≈øalvation; for the≈øe men teach that as there is no reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God without remi≈øsion of ≈øin, ≈øo no ≈øin is remitted without confe≈øsion (or at lea≈øt a purpo≈øe thereof) unto a Prie≈øt; for ≈øaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

Now in the ca≈øe of ≈øin there cannot be greater danger, nor greater happine≈øs than to decline the ≈øtroke; di≈øcreet coun≈øel therefore that tends to that end is much to be pri≈øed.

And if thou gain a ≈øight of thy ≈øin, very ≈øeldom ≈øhall thy contrition be truly poi≈øed; either thy ≈øorrow ≈øwallowing up thy ≈øelf or el≈øe thy ≈øin ≈øwallowing up thy ≈øorrow: ≈øure it is not the lea≈øt art ≈øo to order <hi>contrition</hi> aright, that it may ari≈øe upon ju≈øt cau≈øe, be moderated with fitting di≈øcretion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to ≈øuch ends, that it may prove a godly ≈øorrow, and ≈øuch which accompanieth ≈øalvation.

               <p>SO by Gods mercy, and the guidance of his good Spirit, we are now in the haven, and at the end of this Treati≈øe. A journey hath been taken not long, (to ≈øpeak truly) nor tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but dangerous and difficult; ≈øpent rather in the beating of unknown paths, or renewing of ancient tracts worn out, and well-nigh de≈øaced with de≈øuetude, than in following any u≈øuall rode or beaten way before us; for in this voyage (we may boldly ≈øay) not many Travellers, e≈øpecially that ≈øet out from home with us, have kept us company. And yet the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter, as it concerns all Chri≈øtians, ≈øo I ≈øuppo≈øe, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to none of tho≈øe <hi>My≈øteries</hi> in power and operation, that are committed to the Lords Stewards, much profiting, but much oppo≈øing fle≈øhly wi≈ødome; as the be≈øt potions are the mo≈øt bitter, and the more repugnant to the di≈øea≈øe, the more
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:37267:176"/>≈øanative. The Spirit is contrary to the fle≈øh, and the work of Chri≈øtianity is to deny our ≈øelves, and to take up <hi>Chri≈øt's cro≈ø≈øe.</hi> You ≈øhall hardly ≈øee a man that will lay open his infirmities, though I read of an <hi>Apostle</hi>
